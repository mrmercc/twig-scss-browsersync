# twig-scss-browsersync

A starter boilerplate to get :shit: done with a nice little workflow.

1) `yarn` to fetch npm dependencies

2) `gulp` to start the server and watch for changes

Dev work happens in `src`. Site gets compiled in `dist`

It's not complete, and it's not for everyone. But it works pretty well for me! :tada:
